        <p>
          As mentioned earlier my name is Prince Godwyll. Im a Ghanaian who
          reside currently at Accra the capital of the country. Im currently
          enrolled in a software development course which im looking forward to
          learning more and create more softwares in the coming days of our Tech
          wolrd. Programming was'nt an option after i completed high school
          because i really loved Economics and Math so i decided to learn
          programming because i loved it after it was introduced to me by a
          friend. I fell for programming after some few tutorials i watched on
          Youtube and decided to become a Software developer. The journey to
          become a developer was not easy but after persistent and consistent
          practices i was able to get the basic syntax.

          Ghana Trade with European states flourished after contact with the
          Portuguese in the 15th century, and the British established a Crown
          Colony, the Gold Coast, in 1874. Ghana became the first sub-Saharan
          African country to gain its independence in 1957. <br />
